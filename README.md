# Guided-Inquiry-9-----Budget-Tracker

## A budget tracker used for calculating any large number amounts. The calculations will round to the 2nd decimal number. 

I built this project using HTML, SASS and JavaScript. For JavaScript, I made sure to use one Budget class with methods for calculating income minus expenses while having seperate functions to update the displays whenever the user inputs a number. 

The tracker does not accept any symbols, only numbers. 

Upon first glance, the left hand side is for typing income and adding income table data cells, the right hand side for typing expenses and adding expense table data cells.
