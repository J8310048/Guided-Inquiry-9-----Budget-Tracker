# Guided-Inquiry-9-----Budget-Tracker

## A budget tracker used for calculating any large number amounts. The calculations will round to the 2nd decimal number. 

I built this project using HTML, SASS and JavaScript. For JavaScript, I made sure to use one Budget class with methods for calculating income minus expenses while having seperate functions to update the displays whenever the user inputs a number. The tracker does not accept any symbols, only numbers.
